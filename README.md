# push_swap

A simple project about sorting a list of non duplicate numbers in the least amount of instructions as possible. For the sorting you are limited to two stacks and you can only push, rotate and swap between the stacks. The program uses linked lists to handle the sorting. For the sorting algorithm it is a combination of radix and chunk sort.
